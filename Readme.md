Dockerfile

# Dockerfile is simple text file with instructions to build image, basicaly dockerfile is automation of Docker Image Creation

(Dockefile) =====> (docker build Dockerfile) ======> (docker image)

Step 1 : Create a file named Dockerfile (without extension)
```
# touch DockerFile
```


Some block in Dockerfile

* [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file)
* [FROM](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) Sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions.
* [MAINTAINER (deprecated - use LABEL instead)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#maintainer-deprecated) Set the Author field of the generated images.
* [RUN](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run) execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results.
* [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) provide defaults for an executing container.
* [EXPOSE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose) informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.  NOTE: does not actually make ports accessible.
* [ENV](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env) sets environment variable.
* [ADD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add) copies new files, directories or remote file to container.  Invalidates caches. Avoid `ADD` and use `COPY` instead.
* [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) copies new files or directories to container.  By default this copies as root regardless of the USER/WORKDIR settings.  Use `--chown=<user>:<group>` to give ownership to another user/group.  (Same for `ADD`.)
* [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint) configures a container that will run as an executable.
* [VOLUME](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#volume) creates a mount point for externally mounted volumes or other containers.
* [USER](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user) sets the user name for following RUN / CMD / ENTRYPOINT commands.
* [WORKDIR](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir) sets the working directory.
* [ARG](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg) defines a build-time variable.
* [ONBUILD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#onbuild) adds a trigger instruction when the image is used as the base for another build.
* [STOPSIGNAL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#stopsignal) sets the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit.
* [LABEL](https://docs.docker.com/config/labels-custom-metadata/) apply key/value metadata to your images, containers, or daemons.
* [SHELL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#shell) override default shell is used by docker to run commands.
* [HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) tells docker how to test a container to check that it is still working.


Example Dockerfile

FYI ```FROM``` instructions support variables that are declared by any ```ARG``` instructions that occur before the first ```FROM```

Step 2 : Add instructions in Dockerfile
```
ARG VERSION=latest
FROM busybox:$VERSION
ARG VERSION
RUN echo $VERSION > image_version
```

Step 3 : Build dockerfile to create image
```
# docker build -f imageName:TAG-IF-Needed LOCATION_TO_Dockerfile/Dockerfile

# docker build -f myBusybox:1.1 Dockerfile

if you are in the same directory of your Dockerfile 
# docker build -f myBusybox:1.1 .
```

Step 4 : Run image to create container
```
# docker run myBusybox
```
